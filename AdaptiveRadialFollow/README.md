Reinstall after September 10, 2025

massive props to abstractqbit for making the original radial follow and making bezier interpolator, which i would recommend using with this over temporal resampler, because the cursor acts weird with temporal.

how to use for noobs

1. go to otd
2. plugin manager
3. file top left
4. alternate source
5. owner: fridgesrunning
6. apply
7. profit

You should enable this in plugins explicitly before enabling any interpolator.
